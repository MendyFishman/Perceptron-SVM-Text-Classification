# Perceptron-SVM-Text-Classification

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for my Applied Mathematics degree project, where I explored the fascinating realm of Machine Learning and Classification. The project covers three main parts:

## part 1: Perceptron Algorithm
Highlights:

Reviewed the intuition behind the Perceptron and provided a proof of algorithm convergence.
Implemented the Perceptron algorithm and applied it to the well-known Iris dataset.
Repository Contents:

perceptron part in code: Contains the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm and used for the analysis on the Iris dataset.

## Part 2: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Highlights:

Explored SVM's Hard Margin, Soft Margin, and Kernel Method importance.
Analyzed the uniqueness and existence of solutions in Hard Margin SVM.
Conducted an in-depth analysis of the convexity of SVM optimization problems.
Implemented Soft Margin SVM using Batch Gradient Descent.
Repository Contents:

svm part in code: Includes implementations and analyses related to SVM.

## Part 3: Text Classification 
Highlights:

Text Classification involving preprocessing and vectorizing textual data using the tf-idf method.
Applied Soft Margin SVM to identify racist tweets.
Repository Contents:
text-classification part in code: Holds code related to the Text Classification and identifying racist tweets.
